After Navratri, the effigies of Ravan, Kumbhakaran and Meghnad are burnt on the Dashmi to symbolise victory of the good over the evil. Earlier, Ravan dahan used to be an engaging affair, specially for children, due to bursting of crackers as soon as effigies were burnt.

Owing to these restrictions, several Ramlila committees have moved on to hi-tech innovations to celebrate the festival. Some are planning to replace fireworks with acoustic effects mimicking the continuous barrage of firecrackers bursting when the effigies of demon king are burnt on Dussehra. A few others have said they would explore other options.
